# Data-Visualization
Data visualisation allows sales representatives, marketing teams, and business executives to easily detect patterns in large volumes of disorganised data. By using visual data discovery tools, organizations can effectively keep track of not just sales performance, but team and personnel performances, business conditions, and marketing trends as well.
